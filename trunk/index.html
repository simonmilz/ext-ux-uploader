        <h1>Ext.ux.uploader package</h1>
        
        <p>
        The Ext.ux.uploader package provides a flexible framework for
        adding upload functionality to your application.
        </p>

        <p>
        The core of the package is an abstract adapter class that features
        queue functionality, simultaneous uploads, and a standardized event
        model. So far, there are implementation for gears and standard html
        forms. I plan on adding a swf implementation if I have time.
        </p>

        <p>
        Also included is a simple Panel extensions that implements the
        adapters as well as a demonstation page written in php to provide
        sample usage.
